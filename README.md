How it works 
Continuous integration (CI): Automatically merges code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. CI also includes automated testing to ensure the merged code is reliable.
Continuous delivery (CD): Automatically deploys the merged code to production.
Benefits
Faster delivery
CI/CD pipelines allow for frequent, reliable updates, which can shorten the time it takes to release new features and bug fixes. 
Higher quality code
CI/CD pipelines can help identify bugs early in the development process, which can lead to higher quality code. 
Improved security
CI/CD pipelines can help ensure that code is secure and in a releasable state. 
Better collaboration
CI/CD is a key part of DevOps, which promotes collaboration between development and operations teams.
